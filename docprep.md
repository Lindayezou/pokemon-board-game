## Technologies:
  Angular
  Express server
  MongoDB
  Sockets.io
  Facebook Oauth
  Mongoose
  Q 
  Mocha
  Chai
  ???

## Team Roles:
  Product Owner: Alex Chou
  Scrum Master: Hitesh Lala
  Developer Team: Linda Zhou, Arthi Palaniappan

## Division of Labour:
  We would like to have each of us work on every part of the app
  Equal division of labour on frontend, backend, database.
  Thinking of working in pairs and other pair will review code before
  merging

## Learning Goals:
  We all want to learn all aspects of the stack but some of us want to
  focus on specific areas
  Alex, Hitesh - facebook auth, socket.io, databases
  Linda - css, html, frontend
  Arthi - databases

## Git workflow:
 1. Fork a copy from organization
 2. Clone a local copy from your personal repo
 3. Git pull --rebase 'remote master'
 4. Make a new branch for each feature you work on
 5. Git pull --rebase 'remote master' 'new branch'
 6. Git push 'your personal repo' 'branch'
 7. From your github account make a pull request to organization repo

## Stretched Goals:
  Make front end look REALLY goood
  Evolving pokemon
  Facebook invite friends
  Add branching paths to game
  Increase number of players per game
  Facebook updates on game status
  Music to our game
  In game alias
  Additional/more complicated event/item cards
  User game stats
  Wating list in the games html page 
  Chat box between player

## Data:
  board state saved as an object
  each user is an object with {position,gymLeaderDefeated,lastCity, bank, party, cards}
  an array for each group of pokemon containing the ids for pokemon

## Tech Stack:
   ### Angular:
    Mainly because of the 2 way data bind
    Creating a single page game - donâ€™t have to reload entire page
    Wanted to spend more time on game logic instead of learning a new tech

  ### Express Server:
    No call back hell/pyramid of doom
  
  ### MongoDB:
    Use Mongoose to connect and Q to promisify
    Need to store objects and arrays
    Record Size Limit: 16MB
    

## Data Objects:
